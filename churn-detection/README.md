## Project overview 


#### Step
1. Dataset 
2. Algorithm for churn detection 
3. Load data in hadoop 
+ Load data to HDFS 
+ MapReduce program to build the model 
+ Parallel processing offered by MapReduce can build the model in a short span of time 
4. Run analysis


### Solution  
+ Build model to take customer churn as input to predict the future churners 
+ Bayes' theorem 
+ Run bayes algo in prompt with Node.js

#### Datasets 
+ Pre processing of raw data 
+ Deal with structured, semi-structured and unstructured datasets
