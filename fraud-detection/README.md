+ K-Means cluster : 

## Project description 
+ Build a fraud detection system 
+ Fraud detection system for banking system using Hadoop , Spark and Machine learning. The fraud detection system will predict whether a payment transaction is a suspect transaction. 
    + If suspicious transaction is detected, then the payment processing system can step up security and ask for more information from the account holder before the transaction can be processed


## Tech stack 
+ Hadoop 
+ Spark 
+ Machine learning 




## Steps 
+ Dataset 
+ Design the model from dataset - clean the dataset 
+ Create fraud detection model 
+ Put model into use 

## Practices : 
+ Load dataset 
+ Clean dataset 
+ Field related: Date, Code, Amount 

+ Find relevant fields : 
+ Machine learning for fraud detection : predict outcome future transactions
+ Unsupervised machine learning method : detect anomalies in historical transaction data. 
+ Selected the unsupervised machine learning method - historical transaction dataset - pattern 

+ Clustering = unsupervised machine learning method : pattern in large datasets - several algorithms available to cluster data - selection = K - Means algorithm

+ Design high level architecture :
