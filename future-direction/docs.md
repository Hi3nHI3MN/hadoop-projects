# Future directions 
+ Hadoop on cloud 
    + distributed system - distributed node 
    + Deploy Hadoop on cloud server
        + Linux - win based server
        + OS 
        + CPU- storage space - server config process 
        + Provision the server - deploy hadoop manually or using automated deploy tool : Ansible  
    + Using Hadoop as a service 
        + Amazon elastic mapreduce - Amazon EMR from Amazon is Hadoop as a service on cloud 
        + Hadoop cluster in HDInsight 
            + Head node 
            + Woker node 
+ NoSQL    
    + Online transaction processing system - data warehousing system 
    + Type of NoSQL database 
        + Wide column stores : 
        + Key value 
        + Document base 
        + Graph database : node and edge 
+ In memory database 
+ Apache Spark vs Apache Ignite 
    + AS : engine for data analytics 
        + Loads data from disk based database into RAM for processsing 
    + AI : building OLTP solution 
        + AI as Hadoopaccelerator 
        + Compatible with HDFS 
        + in mem database - high performance distributed database management - distributed computing system - data stream processing system - run a cluster of nodes - 
        + provides full ACID support for transactions which make it an attractive choice for building OLTP system 
        + distributed computing pattern : map reduce, fork join, parallel computations on a cluster of computer
